abstract: Given the widespread adoption of renewable energy, the role of battery energy storage systems (BESs) in ensuring the reliable operation of BES-integrated power systems has become prominent. Due to the high costs of BESs, current research focuses on spreading out BES costs by energy sharing between multi-entities, emphasizing the averaged economic performance. However, BESâ€™s average economic performance does not ensure operational profitability, due to several outstanding considerations on interplays between BES use scenarios, operational costs, capital costs, storage utilization, and sharing rate. Here we show that a consistent evaluation framework across use scenarios which can optimize the BES operational efficiency and profitability, validated by representative use scenarios, i.e., Community Energy Storage Sharing (CESS), Personal Energy Storage (PES), and Personal Energy Storage Sharing (PESS). Incorporating real-world operational data, CESS stands out with the lowest operational cost at 48,063 euros, and the highest discharge capacity at 3552 kWh, facilitated by inter-user resource sharing with a sharing rate of 17.30%. CESS incurs the lowest capital cost at 518,887 euros, 32% economically efficient compared to PES and PESS, boosting immediate BES integration. By consistently evaluating heterogeneous BES use scenarios, particularly for distributed BES sharing in residential communities characterized by controllable loads, this work presents new possibilities for system operators that one can regulate inter-user sharing capability, i.e., the sharing rate, for optimized operational efficiency and profitability.
