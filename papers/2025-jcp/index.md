abstract: Carbon flow analysis plays a crucial role in understanding carbon emissions in integrated energy systems (IES), serving as the basis for constructing carbon networks. Among existing methods, the carbon factor approach is commonly used to derive carbon flow data. However, those carbon factors are essentially statistical averages, which lead to inaccuracies and a lack of dynamic characteristics. This absence of dynamic features results in ambiguity in the allocation of carbon emissions within IES. To address this issue, this study proposes the concept of energy-carbon flow mapping, integrating carbon emission factors and utilizing network analysis. Specifically, life cycle analysis (LCA) methods are employed to enhance precision, and energy-carbon flow mapping is used to construct a dynamic carbon network. This approach successfully improves the spatiotemporal resolution and traceability of carbon emissions, enabling precise quantification and analysis. In essence, this study presents a framework for determining the traceability of energy-related carbon emissions. A virtual IES14 carbon network model is constructed for an industrial park in Nanjing to demonstrate the feasibility of this method. The results demonstrate that the proposed model and analytical approach are effective and accurate in quantifying the spatiotemporal distribution of carbon emissions. Furthermore, the carbon footprint of energy can be efficiently traced, laying a solid foundation for future discussions on risk profiling and the optimization of low-carbon energy dispatch in IES.
